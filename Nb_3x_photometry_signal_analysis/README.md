# Notebook 3:
processing neural data 
input: notebook 2 
output: same as notebook 2 but with neural data processed. 

3_a: df/f using a Sliding window of 10 seconds and 10 percentile to calculate baseline.  

3_b: df/f using a Sliding window of 10 seconds and 10 percentile to calculate baseline.  Z score on full session. 

3_c: df/f using a Sliding window of 10 seconds and 10 percentile to calculate baseline and 10 seconds Z score sliding window.

3_d: df/f using a Sliding window of 10 seconds and 10 percentile to calculate baseline.  Z score on full session. Smoothing using 1 sec sliding window with avg. 

3_e: df/f using a Sliding window of 10 seconds and 10 percentile to calculate baseline.  Z score on full session. Take the derivative of that.
