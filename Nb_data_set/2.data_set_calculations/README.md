# 2.data_set_calculate:
Per session
extracting features (numbers!) from the traces per session, i.e. each sessions is avg and represented by one number. 

### [right_side_of_the_brain:](https://github.com/gilmandelbaum/analysis-pipeline-for-photometry_ex/tree/master/Nb_data_set/data_set_calculations/right_side_of_the_brain) 
all notebooks below are for the right hemisphere. 

**data_set_calculations_signal_magnitude_right_side.ipynb:**
calculates the max peak of the photometry signal after choice lick per session per condition. Find the max peak and takes the avg on 100ms around that.

**data_set_calculations_signal_pre_post_choice_right_side.ipynb:**
calculate the avg photometry signal 500 ms before the response lick vs 1 sec after the choice lick. 

### [left_side_of_the_brain:](https://github.com/gilmandelbaum/analysis-pipeline-for-photometry_ex/tree/master/Nb_data_set/data_set_calculations/left_side_of_the_brain) 

**data_set_calculations_signal_magnitude_left_side.ipynb:**
calculates the max peak of the photometry signal after choice lick per session per condition. Find the max peak and takes the avg on 100ms around that.
all notebooks below are for the left hemisphere. 

**data_set_calculations_signal_pre_post_choice_left_side.ipynb:**
calculate the avg photometry signal 500 ms before the response lick vs 1 sec after the choice lick.
