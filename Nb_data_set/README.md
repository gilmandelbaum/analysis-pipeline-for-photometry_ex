# Nb_data_set (Data set analysis)

The structure of the data analysis folders is: 
name of analysis-->seq to be analyzed-->type of analysis-->period analyzed.


[0.data set generate:](https://github.com/gilmandelbaum/analysis-pipeline-for-photometry_ex/tree/master/Nb_data_set/0.data_set_generate)
generating data set of interest from photometry signal or trial data to use for analysis. 

[1.data_set_lineplot:](https://github.com/gilmandelbaum/analysis-pipeline-for-photometry_ex/tree/master/Nb_data_set/data_set_lineplot)
Various types of line plots. Notebookes can also run with a papermill to plot different periods of interest one after the other. 

[2.data_set_calculate:](https://github.com/gilmandelbaum/analysis-pipeline-for-photometry_ex/tree/master/Nb_data_set/data_set_calculations)
Per session. Extracting features (numbers!) from the traces per session, i.e. each sessions is avg and represented by one number. 

[3.data_set_correlations:](https://github.com/gilmandelbaum/analysis-pipeline-for-photometry_ex/tree/master/Nb_data_set/3.data_set_correlations)
Per trial. Extracting features (numbers!) from the traces and from the behavior to see if they are correlated. Each trial is treated independently.
