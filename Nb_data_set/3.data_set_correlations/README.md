#3.data_set_correlations: 
(per trial)
extracting features (numbers!) from the traces and from the behavior to see if they are correlated. Each trial is treated independently. 

### [right_side_of_the_brain:](https://github.com/gilmandelbaum/analysis-pipeline-for-photometry_ex/tree/master/Nb_data_set/3.data_set_correlations/right_side_of_the_brain) 
all notebooks below are for the right hemisphere. 

**data_set_correlations_rt_vs_signal_magnitude_right_side.ipynb:**
calculates the max peak of the photometry signal after choice lick per trial per in each conidtion along side the response time of the next trial. 
For example,  we can ask if the response time on the switch trial (a few seconds later..) is correlated with the magnitude of signal on the lose trial before. 

**data_set_correlations_rt_vs_AUC_right_side.ipynb:**
calculates the area under the curve photometry signal after choice lick to 2 seconds. along side the response time of the next trial. 
For example,  we can ask if the response time on the switch trial (a few seconds later..) is correlated with the area under the curve on the lose trial before.
